# emacs-config
My journey through configuring emacs to my liking.

## Notes
+ The config file (.emacs)  for windows is in `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\`
+

## Useful commands/keybinds
Emacs manual [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual).

+ `C` is the Ctrl key and `M` is the  Alt key.

+ `C-x k buffername`: kills the current buffer

+ `C-g` or `<ESC> <ESC> <ESC>`: Cancel a half-typed command

+ `C-_`: Undo change in current buffer contents
